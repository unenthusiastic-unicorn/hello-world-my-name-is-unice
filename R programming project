I love data storytelling because it helps to give meanings to the digital world around us. As a Computational Communications student, people often ask me, "What exactly do you study?". 
I have started this blogpost to uncover some of my research interests and share with the world the power of computational social sciences. Unlike other data-driven mahors like data science and business analytics, computational social sciences connect the dots between human behaviours and their digital interactions online - individually and with others. 
This semester, I embarked on a data project to crack the secret formula on the success of Netflix's Marketing campaigns. I decided to share with others because I had so much fun analyzing social network diagrams and my professor loved my work (got an A+ for my project).
